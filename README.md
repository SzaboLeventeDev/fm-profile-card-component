## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

In this challange I learned to positioning multiple images and tried another way to create a color with HSL.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<body>
  ...
</body>
```
```css
.body {
  background: url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg"), hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  background-position: right calc(35vw + 50%) bottom calc(30vh - 15%), left calc(35vw + 35%) top calc(60vh + 20%);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}


### Continued development

In the future, I would like to develop my skills in positioning more complex image combinations in one place and in responsive designing. 

I would like to extend my knowledge to JavaScript, to build more complex sites.
